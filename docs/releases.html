                        <ul class="changeLogList">
                            <li>Added: Fullstats mode/alias. Basically for stuff where you need to be at or as close to 100% hp this will set sip mana and health to 99% (can't do 100, tried) and upon hitting 99% mana and hp will do the action. Useful for write journal, board ship etc. So try fl board ship # or fl write journal page 3</li>
                            <li>Added: atr or atr on/off aliases added to more easily toggle serverside auto tree usage. atr off will not stop Wunder from trying to tree if you are locked, it will still try that of course.</li>

                            <li>Fixed: Yanked out a lot of that stupid retardation detection that made you think you had retard instead of aeon on sluggish messages. I'll think on how to improve this for later.</li>
